###Create a SpringBoot application for Books and Authors

Create a new SpringBoot application for Books and Authors. Each Author can write many books and each book can have many Authors. Use the `@ManyToMany` annotation to indicate the relationship in your database.

Create an instance of the books and authors in the home controller and visit the web page to run the code and populate the arraylists of books and authors. Then check out the database to make sure your tables were created correctly and your data has persisted. You should also see a join table to keep track of the `book_id` and `author_id`.

If you discover something you want to remember for next time then write it down on your knowledge base/cheat sheet and add/commit/push that to GitHub.
